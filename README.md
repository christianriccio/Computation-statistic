Optimization algorithms for functions' minima

I am going to present the two first, very basic, optimization methods for 1 parameter:
1. Tri-section method
2. Golden Section Search
Then i will introduce 'Bracketing' and present how to implement it, also will be presented unconstrained optimization for more than one parameter
