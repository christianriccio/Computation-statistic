Optimization algorithms for functions' minima

I am going to present the two first, very basic, optimization methods for 1 parameter:
1. Tri-section method
2. Golden Section Search


Then i will introduce 'Bracketing' and present how to implement it. It will be usend in combination with:
1. Steepest descent or gradient descent
2. Newton-Raphson method
